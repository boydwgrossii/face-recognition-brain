To the student who comes across this:  This is the final version of the front end project.  This isn't just for you to copy
and move on.  It's my hope that this will help you through the project and see how it works.  In this version, we remove
the need to rely on the install of Clarifai and write what it needs to do instead.

Study well and have fun!
